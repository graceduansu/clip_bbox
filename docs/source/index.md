# Welcome to clip_bbox's documentation!

## Installation

Use pip to install clip_bbox as a Python package:

    $ pip install clip-bbox

### Use As a Command Line Script

```
usage: python -m clip_bbox [-h] imgpath caption outpath

positional arguments:
  imgpath     path to input image
  caption     caption of input image
  outpath     path to output image displaying bounding boxes

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```

To draw bounding boxes on an image based on its caption, run

    $ python -m clip_bbox "path/to/img.png" "caption of your image" "path/to/output_path.png"

#### Usage Example
```eval_rst
.. image:: ../images/command_line_usage.gif
```

### Use As a Python Module

To draw bounding boxes on an image based on its caption, do the following:

```python
from clip_bbox import run_clip_bbox

run_clip_bbox("path/to/img.png", "caption of your image", "path/to/output_path.png")
```

Using the `run_clip_bbox()` will result in an output image displaying the original image, the similarity heatmap between then spatial and text embeddings from CLIP, and the image with bounding boxes & heatmap drawn on top of it. 

Here is an example output image:
```eval_rst
.. image:: ../images/example_output.png
```

#### Usage Example

```python
from clip_bbox import run_clip_bbox

run_clip_bbox("rocket.png", "a rocket standing on a launchpad", "result.png")
```

Result: Produces `result.png`, which displays the similarity heatmap and bounding boxes for an image of a rocket and its caption. 
```eval_rst
.. image:: ../images/rocket_result.png
```

```eval_rst
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 4
   :caption: Contents

   modules.rst
```
